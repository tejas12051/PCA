# PCA

📍 What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in various fields, including machine learning, image processing, and economics. Its primary goal is to transform a dataset with numerous correlated variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

🔸 Steps:
✅ Standardize Data: Ensure consistent scales for variables.
✅Covariance Matrix: Calculate covariance matrix of standardized data.
✅Eigenvalues/Vectors: Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
✅Select Components: Choose top eigenvalues for principal components.
✅New Dataset: Multiply original data by selected eigenvectors.


🔸PCA Benefits:
✅Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces data complexity.
✅Noise Elimination: Highlights important signals.
✅Visualization: Simplifies data representation.
✅Feature Selection: Identifies key variables.
✅Data Compression: Efficient storage/processing.
